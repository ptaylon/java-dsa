The cost of stock on each day is given in an array `price[]`. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at `price[i]`. You can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

**Note:** A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously, and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

#### Examples

**Input:** `prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]`  
**Output:** `865`  
**Explanation:** Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => `310 - 100 = 210`. Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 => `695 - 40 = 655`. Maximum Profit = `210 + 655 = 865`.

**Input:** `prices[] = [4, 2, 2, 2, 4]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** Buy the stock on day 3 and sell it on day 4 => `4 - 2 = 2`. Maximum Profit = `2`.

#### Constraints

- \(1 \leq \text{prices.size()} \leq 10^5\)
- \(0 \leq \text{prices[i]} \leq 10^4\)
